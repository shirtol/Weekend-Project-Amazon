# Weekend Project Amazon

## Description

(ðŸ‘‰ ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘ˆ(ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ ðŸ‘ˆ)

In this project I created a mock of Amazon product web page as part of my third weekend project in appleseeds bootcamp.

The purpose of this task was implements everything we learned in the course until now.
This task was challenging because this website include alot of information and elements, but working in ordered manner helps me complete the assignment.

In order to achieve the goal I used HTML for building the web page and CSS for styling.
I used flexbox and grid for items alignment, media query to adapt the site for smaller screen and mobile, and JS for changing the images display
(using jquery library).

Additional work in the future includes working on the carousel part in this site.
